# [Software Engineers are Lazy, and Beyond Just Code](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210727-the-rise-of-never-ending-job-interviews)

It is very common to hear that software engineers are some of the laziest people on the planet, but this is often only in the context of coding. The article by BBC above gives insights about how software engineers can also be lazy in the process of applying to jobs.<br><br>
On a more serious note, the article indicates how companies which have a long interview process consisting of a high number of interviews are often missing out on the opportunity to hire the best talent, because too many interviews are often seen as a red flag by software engineers. It drives them away from the job as they develop doubts about the company's culture in terms of decision making, and they often leave negative comments on review sites discouraging others from applying. Companies might have to put an end to overly complicated hiring processes to prevent candidates from running away.
